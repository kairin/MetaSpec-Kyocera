**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A document management system that automates the processing of monthly meter readings from Kyocera office devices received via email."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an office administrator, I receive monthly meter reading emails from Kyocera devices in my organization. I need to automatically process these emails to extract meter readings, organize them by device, and maintain a searchable history of all readings for maintenance tracking and billing purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new meter reading email in the inbox, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the meter reading is extracted and stored in the correct device folder with proper naming
2. **Given** an email with device identifiers, **When** parsed by the system, **Then** the serial number, model, and reading date are correctly extracted
3. **Given** multiple emails for the same device, **When** processed, **Then** they are organized chronologically without overwriting existing readings
4. **Given** an unparseable email format, **When** processed, **Then** the system logs the error and notifies for manual intervention
5. **Given** processed meter readings, **When** an administrator searches, **Then** they can find readings by device, date, or model

### Edge Cases
- What happens when duplicate emails are received?
- How does system handle emails with missing or invalid device information?
- What occurs when the folder structure is manually modified?
- How are corrupted or malformed email files handled?
- What happens when storage limits are reached?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically process .eml files containing meter readings from Kyocera devices
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract device serial numbers, model information, and reading dates from email content
- **FR-003**: System MUST convert email content to both PDF and plain text formats for archival
- **FR-004**: System MUST organize processed files in a hierarchical structure by device model and serial number
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate standardized filenames including date, model, and serial information
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle duplicate files by appending numeric suffixes to prevent overwrites
- **FR-007**: System MUST process multiple emails in batch operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain a processing log of all operations and errors
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate summary reports of processed meter readings
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate and repair folder structure integrity before and after processing
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle unknown or unparseable emails gracefully with appropriate logging
- **FR-012**: System MUST archive processed emails after successful extraction
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to manually categorize devices when automatic detection fails
- **FR-014**: System MUST track device status and last reading date
- **FR-015**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: email provider integration method - POP3, IMAP, manual file upload?]
- **FR-016**: System MUST retain meter readings for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - regulatory requirements?]
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum number of devices to support?]
- **FR-018**: System MUST process emails within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance requirements - real-time, daily batch?]

### Key Entities
- **Meter Reading Email**: Represents an incoming email containing device meter information, includes metadata like received date, subject, sender
- **Device**: Represents a Kyocera office device with model type, serial number, and maintenance history
- **Meter Reading**: The extracted reading data including counter values, reading date, and device association
- **Processing Log**: Audit trail of all system operations including successes, failures, and manual interventions
- **Device Folder**: Organized storage location for a specific device's historical readings
