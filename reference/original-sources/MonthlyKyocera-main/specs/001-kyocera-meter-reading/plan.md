# Implementation Plan: Kyocera Meter Reading Management System

**Branch**: `001-kyocera-meter-reading` | **Date**: 2025-09-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-kyocera-meter-reading/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code)
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Automated document management system for processing monthly meter readings from Kyocera office devices. System extracts meter data from email files, organizes them by device model and serial number, converts to multiple formats for archival, and maintains a searchable history with comprehensive logging.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 (based on provided user context mentioning Python backend)
**Primary Dependencies**: fpdf (PDF generation), email (standard library for .eml parsing), pathlib (file operations)
**Storage**: File system with hierarchical folder structure (devices/<MODEL>/<SERIAL>/<DATE>/)
**Testing**: pytest with filesystem fixtures
**Target Platform**: Linux/Unix server for automated processing
**Project Type**: single - command-line batch processing tool
**Performance Goals**: Process 100+ emails in under 60 seconds
**Constraints**: Must handle corrupted emails gracefully, prevent data loss from overwrites
**Scale/Scope**: Support 50+ devices, retain 2 years of historical data

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (cli, tests)
- Using framework directly? Yes - direct use of standard libraries
- Single data model? Yes - unified meter reading model
- Avoiding patterns? Yes - no unnecessary abstractions

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes - core processing as library modules
- Libraries listed:
  - email_parser: Extract metadata and content from .eml files
  - device_extractor: Pattern matching for device identification
  - pdf_converter: Generate PDF from text content
  - folder_manager: Directory structure operations
  - meter_processor: Main processing orchestration
- CLI per library: meter-cli with --help/--version/--format options
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? Yes

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes - actual filesystem operations
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase - Understood

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes - JSON format logging
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A - CLI only
- Error context sufficient? Yes - full traceback and file context

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? Yes - migration scripts for folder structure changes

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Single project (command-line batch processing tool)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Email integration method clarification (FR-015)
   - Retention period requirements (FR-016)
   - Maximum device support requirements (FR-017)
   - Performance requirements for processing (FR-018)

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research email integration methods for Python (POP3, IMAP, file upload)"
   Task: "Find best practices for document retention in meter reading systems"
   Task: "Research scalability patterns for file-based document management"
   Task: "Find performance benchmarks for batch email processing"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - MeterReadingEmail entity
   - Device entity
   - MeterReading entity
   - ProcessingLog entity
   - DeviceFolder entity

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - CLI interface contracts for meter-cli
   - Input/output specifications for each service
   - File naming and folder structure contracts

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test email parsing contracts
   - Test device extraction patterns
   - Test folder structure creation
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Process single email scenario
   - Batch processing scenario
   - Duplicate handling scenario
   - Error recovery scenario

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Create CLAUDE.md with project context
   - Include technology stack
   - Document folder structure
   - Add recent changes tracking

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Email parsing contract tests [P]
- Device model creation tasks [P]
- Folder management service tasks
- PDF conversion tasks
- Integration test tasks
- CLI implementation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models → Services → CLI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations - following constitutional principles*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none)
