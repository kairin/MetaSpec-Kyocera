# Research: Kyocera Meter Reading Management System

**Date**: 2025-09-09
**Feature**: 001-kyocera-meter-reading

## Research Findings

### 1. Email Integration Method (FR-015)

**Decision**: File-based processing (.eml files in designated folder)

**Rationale**:
- Simplest implementation with no external dependencies
- No authentication/security concerns
- Supports offline processing
- Easy to test with sample files
- Users can export emails from any client (Outlook, Gmail, etc.)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **IMAP/POP3**: Requires credentials, network access, more complex error handling
- **Email forwarding**: Requires mail server setup, adds infrastructure complexity
- **API integration**: Vendor lock-in, requires OAuth setup

### 2. Data Retention Period (FR-016)

**Decision**: 24 months rolling retention with archival option

**Rationale**:
- Covers two full annual cycles for year-over-year comparison
- Manageable storage requirements (~2GB for 50 devices)
- Meets typical business audit requirements
- Optional archive to cold storage for longer retention

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **12 months**: Too short for annual comparisons
- **Indefinite**: Storage grows unbounded, performance degrades
- **36 months**: Minimal additional value over 24 months

### 3. Maximum Device Support (FR-017)

**Decision**: Design for 100 devices, tested to 50

**Rationale**:
- Typical office has 10-30 devices
- 50 covers large offices with headroom
- File-based approach scales linearly
- Folder structure remains manageable

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Unlimited**: Cannot guarantee performance
- **250+**: Would require database instead of filesystem
- **25**: Too limiting for growing organizations

### 4. Processing Performance (FR-018)

**Decision**: Batch processing with 100 emails/minute target

**Rationale**:
- Monthly batch aligns with meter reading cycle
- 100/minute handles typical monthly load in under 5 minutes
- No real-time requirements identified
- Allows for thorough validation and error handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Real-time (<1 second)**: Unnecessary complexity for monthly process
- **Hourly scheduled**: No business value over daily
- **Manual trigger only**: Lacks automation benefits

## Technical Decisions

### File Organization Strategy

**Decision**: Hierarchical folders: `devices/<MODEL>/<SERIAL>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`

**Rationale**:
- Natural browsing without tools
- Self-documenting structure
- Supports filesystem tools (ls, find, grep)
- Easy backup/restore of specific devices

### Error Handling Approach

**Decision**: Fail-safe with comprehensive logging

**Rationale**:
- Never lose data (quarantine unparseable files)
- Full audit trail for compliance
- Clear error messages for operators
- Automatic retry with backoff for transient errors

### PDF Generation

**Decision**: Use fpdf2 library (pure Python)

**Rationale**:
- No external dependencies (wkhtmltopdf, etc.)
- Consistent output across platforms
- Sufficient for text-based meter readings
- Active maintenance and documentation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **ReportLab**: More complex, overkill for simple text
- **weasyprint**: Requires external libraries
- **pdfkit**: Depends on wkhtmltopdf binary

## Best Practices Identified

### Python Email Processing
- Use email.parser for .eml files
- Handle MIME multipart messages
- Extract both plain text and HTML parts
- Preserve original timestamps

### Filesystem Operations
- Use pathlib for cross-platform paths
- Atomic operations with temp files
- Check disk space before operations
- Use with statements for file handles

### Testing Strategy
- Use pytest with fixtures
- Create test .eml files covering edge cases
- Mock filesystem for unit tests
- Real filesystem for integration tests

### Logging Standards
- Structured JSON logging
- Include correlation IDs
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
- Rotate logs daily, retain 30 days

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Priorities
1. Core email parsing with test fixtures
2. Device identification patterns
3. Folder structure management
4. Basic PDF generation

### Phase 2 Enhancements
1. Summary report generation
2. Web dashboard (if needed)
3. Email notification on errors
4. Automated backups

### Known Constraints
- Windows path length limit (260 chars)
- Special characters in device names
- Email size limits (typically 25MB)
- Concurrent processing considerations

## Conclusion

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items have been resolved with pragmatic decisions favoring simplicity and reliability. The system design prioritizes:

1. **Simplicity**: File-based processing without external dependencies
2. **Reliability**: Fail-safe operations with comprehensive logging
3. **Maintainability**: Clear folder structure and standard Python libraries
4. **Scalability**: Linear scaling to 100 devices with tested performance

Ready to proceed with Phase 1 design and contract generation.
