## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Documents describe a comprehensive meter reading management system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: email processing, device tracking, PDF generation, database archival, web dashboard, TUI
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked retention period and concurrent users as needing clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows identified for processing meter readings
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Device, MeterReading, EmailMessage, Report, ProcessingLog
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN: 2 clarifications needed (retention period, concurrent users)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with minor clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an administrative staff member managing Kyocera office equipment, I need to efficiently process monthly meter readings received via email, organize them by device, generate reports, and maintain a searchable archive for billing and maintenance purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** emails with meter readings in the pending folder, **When** the processing system runs, **Then** all emails are parsed, PDFs/TXT files generated, and files organized by device model/serial/date
2. **Given** processed meter readings, **When** accessing the web dashboard, **Then** I can view usage trends, search historical data, and export reports for departments
3. **Given** a need to find specific device readings, **When** using the terminal interface, **Then** I can navigate by device model, serial number, or date to locate readings
4. **Given** duplicate meter readings for the same device/date, **When** processing, **Then** the system creates uniquely numbered files without overwriting existing data
5. **Given** emails missing device information, **When** processing fails, **Then** files are quarantined with error logging for manual review

### Edge Cases
- What happens when email format is unrecognized? ‚Üí Quarantine with detailed error log
- How does system handle corrupted .eml files? ‚Üí Move to quarantine folder, log error, continue processing others
- What if device serial cannot be extracted? ‚Üí Try multiple extraction methods, then quarantine if all fail
- How are duplicate readings on same date handled? ‚Üí Append sequence numbers (_1, _2, etc.)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST process .eml files containing meter readings from Kyocera devices
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract device serial numbers from email filename, subject, or body content
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate both PDF and TXT versions of meter readings for each email
- **FR-004**: System MUST organize files in hierarchical folders: devices/MODEL/SERIAL/YYYY-MM-DD/
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve original .eml files after processing (never delete)
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle duplicate readings by appending sequence numbers to filenames
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a terminal user interface for interactive management
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a web dashboard for analytics and reporting
- **FR-009**: System MUST archive all readings in a queryable database for long-term storage
- **FR-010**: System MUST log all processing actions, errors, and file movements in a summary file
- **FR-011**: System MUST track device status and maintain inventory of all known devices
- **FR-012**: System MUST support batch processing of multiple emails in a single run
- **FR-013**: System MUST quarantine failed emails for manual review without stopping the batch
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate and auto-fix folder structure issues before processing
- **FR-015**: System MUST support export of data in multiple formats (Markdown, YAML, PDF)
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide search capability across all meter readings
- **FR-017**: System MUST generate monthly and yearly usage reports per device
- **FR-018**: System MUST retain data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - 24 months suggested in config but not confirmed]
- **FR-019**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: number of concurrent users for web dashboard not specified]
- **FR-020**: System MUST process emails at rate of 100 emails/minute minimum

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Device**: Represents a Kyocera office device with model, serial number, location, and status
- **MeterReading**: Individual meter reading with date, counters, device reference, and source email
- **EmailMessage**: Original email containing meter data with metadata (sender, date, subject, body)
- **Report**: Generated output document (PDF/TXT/MD/YAML) containing formatted meter data
- **ProcessingLog**: Audit trail of all system actions, errors, and file movements

2. **Organization**: Systematic filing by device model, serial, and date
3. **Accessibility**: Multiple interfaces (CLI, TUI, Web) for different user needs
4. **Analytics**: Historical trends and usage patterns for decision making
5. **Compliance**: Audit trail and long-term archival for billing verification
6. **Reliability**: Error handling and quarantine system ensures no data loss

### User Groups
